## Description
Eris is a PoC (Proof of Concept) .NET-based file padding program used to manipulate file's size by enlarging with random garbage data, or padding, without affecting its functionality.

This file padding method is known in [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001/), as a part of file obfuscation:
<blockquote>
Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware. This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.
</blockquote>
</br>

## Usage

```cmd
dotnet eris.dll -path <path> [options]
```
Argument:
<blockquote>
-path &lt;path&gt;: A path of a file to be enlarge/padded.
</blockquote>
</br>
Options:
<blockquote>

-sizeGB &lt;size&gt;: Adjust the size of a padded file in gigabytes (GB)

-sizeMB &lt;size&gt;: Adjust the size of a padded file in megabytes (MB)

(If the option -sizeMB or -sizeGB was not specified, A default padded size of 100 MB will be set.)

---
-n: Null-based padding bytes.

-z: Zero-based padding bytes.

-r: Randomized-based padding bytes.

(A default padding byte character is null-based padding type. ('-n'))
</blockquote>

---
example (where FileToPad.exe's size will enlarge with 2GB of padded bytes.):
```cmd
dotnet eris.dll -path C:\FileToPad.exe -sizeGB 2
```
